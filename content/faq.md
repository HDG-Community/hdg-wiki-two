HDG is not always the most straightforward of things at times, and the Lorets have received a great many questions we've strived to answer for folks over the past few years. This article is a compilation of many of the most common we receive, especially from newcomers to the setting.

If you can't find the answers you are seeking here, you can check out the rest of the Guide, as many articles have more topical FAQs on their respective pages. If you still have inquires, you can always head on over to the [HDG Community Server](https://discord.gg/WgssQ6SR4q) and ask the Lorets over in the setting questions channel.

(TODO - A lot of these questions are missing answers - if you wanna write up a response for one, ping me with it and I'll add it on here. I tried to make the ones which still need answering by having them start with @)
## General Setting
### @Human Domestication Guide? What's that?
(TODO)
### Why does every story seem to end with domestication?
Because it's hot.

No, seriously, that's it. This is a kink setting and we think it's hot. That's why you don't see too many stories where the independent stays independent, and why the ones where that does happen are usually comedic — they're basically the community poking gentle fun at itself.
### @Why aren't there any stories where the terran wins?!
(TODO)
### Why do so many sophonts become florets? Where are all the independents?
(TODO)

### Why does HDG have Axioms?
The thing that makes HDG special is the vibe it has — the coziness inextricably wrapped up with the horror. Some stories may lean more to one side or the other, but they all carry those two central feelings with them: things may be scary, but in the end it'll be alright, whether you want it to be or not.

When HDG was just a few sophonts sharing stories back and forth, it was easy to keep things more or less aligned with those vibes. However, now that HDG is a shared setting enjoying explosive growth, lots of people are coming to HDG without having been a part of that early community, and so didn't have the opportunity to learn-by-doing the way those authors did. The Axioms exist to help new writers, serving as a lighthouse of sorts to show what the core pillars of HDG as a setting are.
### But if this is fanfic, why shouldn't I write whatever I want?
First, we're very excited that you'd like to write something set in the shared HDG universe! We love it when sophonts are creative and we're happy to be a part of a shared creative endeavor — but because it's a shared creative endeavor, we have to have some limits on what's fair game and what isn't. The [[writing-in-hdg|Writing in HDG]] page goes into detail, but here's a brief explanation.

HDG isn't just fanfic — it's something we do together. In order to keep it tightly focused on the core themes and ideas of HDG, we as a community have decided that certain elements that make up those core themes and ideas have a certain inviolable quality to them. For example, it's taken for granted that the Affini act in good faith; they don't abuse florets or use their structural or individual power for what they would consider to be bad ends. Their sense of morality and ethics doesn't align precisely with ours, of course, so what we would consider a violation of consent, they see as a minor wrinkle to be smoothed over with a bit of hypnosis and xenodrugs. (Casual reminder: this is because we think it's hot, not because we think it's right. This is, first and foremost, a kink setting.)
### Is it okay to write a story that otherwise breaks Rules or Axioms if I have a really good idea?
The answer here is "almost certainly not." This is particularly true of the Rules — they exist for community safety reasons and we take them extremely seriously. Don't break the Rules.

When it comes to the Axioms, things get ever so slightly more open, but only ever so slightly. We frequently see new writers come into the setting saying "I want to subvert this trope!" or something similar, without having stuck around long enough or having read enough stories to understand that HDG is already a subversion of science fiction tropes, and subverting a subversion just leads you full circle to the original thing.
## Does the Affini, Terrans, or the setting as a whole have \_\_\_\_\_?
Science fiction is a vast genre with a great many hallmark and iconic features, and at a glance it can be unclear which areas of technology exist within a setting and which laws of reality it is bending for the sake of the narrative.

Generally speaking, if anyone has a given technology in the setting, the Affini have it too - if it's possible, they've either developed it or otherwise have proof-of-concepts under development across the Compact. This means that technologies and other features which aren't yet present in the setting don't have a lot of room to be added (for example, if the Affini came across a species with supernatural powers, that would have wide-reaching consequences on the setting as it would not take the Affini long before they engineered themselves to also tap into those powers).

Be sure to also check out the [[affini-tech|Affini Technology]] and [[terran-tech|Terran Technology]] articles for more details on both the general feel of the technologies in the setting as well as information on specific techs.
