> _“Look I don’t mean to critique the mods decisions, but it really feels like you’re all just trying to destroy this community. Like every thing you change has been for the worst. I’ve been on the internet for years. You really suck at this. I’m not offering to help of course, just trying to undermine your free labor."_
> 
> **The Floret Propagandist's [_From Loret to Floret_](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58870534)**

One of the decisions made by HDG's early creators was to keep the setting somewhat centralized in order to facilitate the collaborative storytelling for any creative who wanted to get involved. This meant that anyone in the community who wanted to write HDG could - not just as a fanwork, but as part of the living, evolving setting. At the same time, this also led to the need for a certain amount of high-level organization for directing and guiding the setting as it continued to grow in those early days, to say nothing of the general community management needs which arose.

If you have been following around since those days, you may have noticed that HDG has grown *considerably* over the past few years. Nowadays, the HDG community is comprised of hundreds of authors and thousands of community members on just the community server alone, and as part of that, the leadership has also grown with the needs of the community. Nowadays, that leadership is responsible for maintaining resources such as this site as well as the official [HDG Community Server](https://discord.gg/WgssQ6SR4q).
## HDG Leadership
Each member of the HDG staff is part of one (or more) of the three groups which each work with each other to help manage the setting in their own way - the **Lorets**, the **Clerks**, and the **Gardeners**. These groups are drawn from both the early creators of the setting and the many wonderful members of the community who have come onboard since, with the teams regularly growing to meet the needs of the ever-expanding community.

The **Lorets** are the setting's guides and curators, maintaining the [[writing-in-hdg|guidelines and lore]] which make HDG what it is. They also are responsible for projects such as this site to help creatives write and create art in the setting, as well as hanging out on the community server answering folks' questions and pointing them to stories which may pique their interest.

> [!LORET]
> The **Coordinators** are a small team of Lorets created to facilitate the transition from the old HDG Wiki to the new HDG Guide (the site you're on right now!). They are responsible for keeping the operations of the site running, as well as directing and organizing the guide's artists, writers, and other contributors for the creation and expansion of the content on the Guide.

The **Clerks** are the team who are in charge of the operations of the community server, helping manage its hundreds of users active every day and keeping it a lovely space for folks to discuss the setting and the stories within. They handle the high-level policy decisions like the rules and channel layouts, as well as a variety of general moderation responsibilities.

Finally, the most recent team to join the staff are the **Gardeners**, who assist the Clerks in the day-to-day moderation and management of the server. They are the backbone of keeping the Community Server a safe and vibrant place for the the community.

**Amberoth**  
Gardener  
she/her

Amberoth joined the community early 2023 and has persisted as the bratty fox that she is since then. Seen pouncing unsuspecting rule breakers or staring at the wall lost in another day dream of plommies or other stories ideas that she swears her ADHD will let her finish one day.

Shortly after discovering HDG in early 2021, Amee realized that we loved this setting so much that she wanted to contribute. So she decided to write [_Germination_](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35972959/), and she haven't stopped. She really enjoys creating xenodruggies, medical procedures, and answering questions about said medical things. And useless lesbians. Those are fun too.

[AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/users/annabool/pseuds/annabool)

Wiki-sceptic yet helps run a wiki; fandom-averse yet accidentally helped build a fandom. Helplessly verbose chronic worldbuilder who was trying to write for a smaller audience this time around and failed. Hates writing her own bios, yet here she is.

[AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/users/AsphodelVeil/pseuds/AsphodelVeil)

AsphodelVeil got entranced by the first couple chapters of the original HDG posted on ROM, filling her with urgent questions. So she asked a friend, who asked a friend, who knew a certain robot, one thing led to another...

Many years passed, and some say she's still wandering the woods, searching for the executive function to finish the next [*Nurture & Acquisitions*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/48096388/) chapter.

Moist Eggs found HDG around mid-2023 and spends far too much time lurking through Discord between work tickets and meetings. She has not actually created anything since words don't word too good and hands don't hand too good, but that doesn't stop her from voraciously consuming what others make.

Clerk  
she/her, it/its

selene is a recovering programmer, musician, and gamedev enthusiast. She first discovered the setting in early 2022 and joined the community proper the following year.

She is found helping out with various background and technical tasks on the community server.

When skoof first read *Divaricated* in 2022, she thought it was a stand-alone story. Then she found the "Join Discord" link on the old wiki and knew that she may never be the same again. Two years and a deerplushification later, she gets to offer this same opportunity to new visitors of the guide as she wields the powers of css and javascript for good and domestication.
